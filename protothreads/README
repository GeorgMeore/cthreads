Protothreads are an extremely limited form of multitasking.
They are stackless, and that means that they can't have local variables in the traditional sense.
Essentially a protothread's state is just the value of the instruction pointer.

This particular implementation (essentially the same as https://dunkels.com/adam/pt/)
is also extremely hacky and has it's limitations (like, for example, that you cannot
YIELD inside switch statements, or use it multiple times on one line).

Actually I believe that a setjmp/longjmp approach would lead to a more robust solution.
